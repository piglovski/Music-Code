# Music-Code

This repository is a collection of projects that explore the intersection of music and programming, with a focus on creating electronic music through code.

I am currently working on a Python script that will create a simple techno sample using sounds generated by librosa. I am also building a sample generator/editor that allows users to input their own sample and manipulate it.
